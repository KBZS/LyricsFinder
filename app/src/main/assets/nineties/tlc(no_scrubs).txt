Now the dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
I can finally see the sun appear
Look at how far we've come
Everything is so clear
Can't believe it's been another year
Your darkest days all fade away
That's why we say
(Can't stop me now)
If you believe in destiny then you will see
(Ain't no stoppin' now)
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Now the dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
Don't be trippin' all over your fears
'Cause the good comes after bad
First you cry and then you laugh
As we head into another year
So hold on tight
All through the night
Let's make it right
(Can't stop me now)
If you believe in destiny then you will see
(Ain't no stoppin' now)
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Sunny!
Sunny!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Sunny!
Sunny!
Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
I can finally see the sun appear
Look at how far we've come
Everything is so clear
Can't believe it's been another year
Your darkest days all fade away
That's why we say
(Can't stop me now)
If you believe in destiny then you will see
(Ain't no stoppin' now)
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Sunny!
Sunny!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Everybody sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Come on and sing
